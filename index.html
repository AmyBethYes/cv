        <p><em>Coding Student on <strong>Udemy</strong></em></p>
        <p>I have been working in the office at <em><a href="https://planbpromotions.com/Plan_B_Promotions">Plan B Promotions</a></em>
          for the past three years. After coming to terms that my current position
          is stagnant, I decided to learn coding from home so that I could pursue
          a new career, build and design amazing things, and earn financial freedom.
          I started on <em>Codecademy</em> but have recently switched to online lessons
          by Angela Yu. So far, I am enjoying Angela's lessons on <em>Udemy</em> much
          more than the <em>Codecademy</em> lessons.</p></td>

  <h3>Education</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Beachwood Elementary School
      <ul>
        <li>This was a small but very pleasant grade school which
      I attended until I was 12 years old.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Toms River Intermediate West
        <ul>
          <li>My middle school mascot was a dolphin.
          </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.keystoneschoolonline.com/">Keystone National Highschool</a>
      <ul>
        <li>I attended high school remotely. Online schooling was
        relatively rare at the time, but I graduated with a 4.0
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://bartonccc.edu/">Barton Community College</a>
      <ul>
        <li>I also completed this two year degree online.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/">Kansas State University</a>
      <ul>
        <li>I finished my B.S. in Dietetics through K State but unfortunately
          never wound up working in the field that I studied. My college experience
          still mde a deep impact on me and nurtured my love of learning.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Codecademy
      <ul>
        <li>I completed less than a month of study using Codecademy. The style of
          instruction used by this platform was not working for me, but it provided
          a good introduction to coding.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a>
      <ul>
        <li>
          This is where I am right this very moment. I am thoroughly enjoying Angela
          Yu's method of teaching and all of the useful tools and resources I have been
          introduced to so far.
        </li>
        <li>I am very excited to continue this journey and achieve my goal of becoming
          a professional coder and web developer.
